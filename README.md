# Student-Performance-Dashboard
This project aims to analyze the factors that affect student performance in a particular school district and provide a dashboard for educators to monitor and track student progress. The project will utilize data such as student demographics, standardized test scores, attendance records, and teacher evaluations.


Data sources:

Student demographic data (age, gender, race/ethnicity, etc.)
Standardized test scores (e.g., SAT, ACT, state tests)
Attendance records (e.g., number of absences, tardiness)
Teacher evaluations (e.g., classroom management, teaching effectiveness)
Project objectives:

Identify the factors that have the most significant impact on student performance
Create a dashboard that enables educators to monitor and track student progress
Provide insights and recommendations to improve student performance
Proposed methodology:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and relationships between variables
Statistical modeling to determine the factors that have the most significant impact on student performance
Development of a user interface (UI) to visualize the data and provide educators with actionable insights
UI features:

Student performance overview dashboard: Provides an overview of student performance metrics such as attendance, grades, and test scores.
Student demographics dashboard: Provides a breakdown of student demographics and their corresponding performance metrics.
Teacher evaluation dashboard: Provides a breakdown of teacher evaluations and their corresponding student performance metrics.
Predictive modeling dashboard: Provides predictions on how students will perform in the future based on their current metrics and historical data.
Potential outcomes:

Identification of the factors that have the most significant impact on student performance, enabling educators to develop targeted interventions and strategies to improve student outcomes.
Improved transparency and communication between educators, students, and parents through the use of a user-friendly dashboard.
Enhanced collaboration between educators by providing a platform for sharing best practices and strategies for improving student outcomes.
